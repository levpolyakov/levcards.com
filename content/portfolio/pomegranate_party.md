The "Pomegranate Party" takes place when the mustached Pomegranians terraform a barren Mouthplanet with their lifeseeds.

Out of the lucky mouths are born the Granatfathers who in turn produce little beings called the Pomegranateers that will eventually use the Granatfathers as rockets to blast off into space finding smaller planets to burrow underneath, become the planets' hivemind, grow a moustache on it, thus create new Pomegranians to keep the process going. The unlucky mouths which stay barren are sneered at by the young Pomegranateers, which is considered an important test of wit in their society.
