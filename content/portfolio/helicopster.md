When the spirits that were occupying the form of #Punkin get scattered into the wind after Punkin explodes from too much pressure, some are picked up by Helicopster, a paragon of companionship journeying the skies in search of new friends.

Unlike their previous form, Helicopster has an ego of his own and cannot contain the spirits inside less they take full control of his consciousness, so he releases them out into the open at regular intervals. The quality of being so open to inviting other spirits into Helicopster has a downside when viral spirits masquerading as benevolent ones gain entry and remain inside, consume the rest of the spirits and multiply until they are sufficient in number to take poor Helicopster over, turning him into #Solchopper who vampirically sucks innocent spirits into himself where they are consumed by the collective horde of spiritual darkness.
