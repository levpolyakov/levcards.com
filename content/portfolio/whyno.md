In his natural state of drunken red hot fury, Whyno spends his days headbutting wine barrels to get his fix of "the good stuff" in order to replenish the vital energy he needs to keep doing more of the same. 

<!--more-->

Only, Whyno has to run carefully or else he is liable to break his sensitive wine glass legs from a sharp enough impact, but this in turn has made Whyno a master of stealth, balancing his aforementioned fury with a cat-like carefulness of how to step lightly. This survival requirement for delaying his thirst only makes Whyno angrier on the inside. Will there be an end to Whyno's reign of terror? Why... no.
