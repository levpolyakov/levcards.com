A demonic entity reborn from fire who is able to exert psychic control over spiky balls that are said to be made out of igneous rock which hardened from the lava that Hornsbee was able to psychically manipulate.

<!--more-->

Unlike his previous form of [Hornsbin][1], Hornsbee looses the bird identity of his horns in exchange for getting rid of Framr who was always holding him back. He is on a path of revenge against any Framr he can get his balls on. He develops the psychic abilities through years of emotional torture while being the hostage of Framr in his previous form of [Hornsbin][1].
